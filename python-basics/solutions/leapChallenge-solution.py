# solution to leapChallenge.py

# assign the years to variables in one line, as per instructions
year1 = 2004; year2 = 2016
# all the coding logic in one line
print(True) if (year1 + year2) % 4 == 0 else print(False)

# you can also assign the years in one line in this way:
year3, year4 = 2004, 2016
