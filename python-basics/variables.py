# Simple types of variables used in coding, usually the most common ones you'll see
# You will find new types of variables later on!

# integers - normal, rounded numbers

# float - all real numbers, including decimals, exponentials, etc
# all integers can be floats, but not all floats can be integers

# strings

# boolean - for all your yes or no questions

print("This is what a boolean looks like if it returns True: " + true_bool)
print("This is what a boolean looks like if it returns False: " + false_bool)
