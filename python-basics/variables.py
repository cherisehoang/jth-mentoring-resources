# Simple types of variables used in coding, usually the most common ones you'll see
# You will find new types of variables later on!

# integers - normal, rounded numbers
integer = 1

# float - all real numbers, including decimals, exponentials, etc
# all integers can be floats, but not all floats can be integers
float_number = 25.034
print(float_number)

# strings
some_string = "hello this is a string"
print(some_string)

# boolean - for all your yes or no questions
true_bool = True
false_bool = False
print("This is what a boolean looks like if it returns True: " + true_bool)
print("This is what a boolean looks like if it returns False: " + false_bool)

# lists - can be called arrays in other languages
# they all have square brackets! -> []
number_list = [1,2,3]
word_list = ["i", "cant", "think", "of", "things", "to", "write"]

# in lists, the counter starts at 0. 
# take a look at number_list: the first position is position 0, and is the number '1'.
