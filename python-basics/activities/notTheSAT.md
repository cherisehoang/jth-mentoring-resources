# Basic Addition and Subtraction

Write a Python program that will add your two favourite numbers, and print that sum.
Then reverse that sum using subtraction, and print that value too.
Expected example output:
```
32
```

Name the file: **add.py**


# Is it a leap year?

Write a Python program that will determine whether a given year is a leap year, and return true if it is a leap year, or false if it isn't.
Expected example output:
```
True
```

Name the file: **leapYear.py**

*Psst! Hint: use modulus*


# Challenge Exercise

Write a Python program using only one line of code, that will add two given years and determine if that new number is a leap year. It should return true if it is a leap year, and false if it isn't.
*This excludes the line where you assign a value to the year you'll be using.*
Expected example output:
```
False
```
